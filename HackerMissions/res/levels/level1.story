Hi, Hacker NEWBIE.
Welcome to this game.
Your mission is to hack into Microsoft...
...And get the source code of Minecraft.
I'm Mr. Wang, I will help you during your task.
You may learn lots of useful information from me.
The servers of Microsoft have a lot of bugs now.
Try your best to find them!

It's too easy for you, right?
But don't look down upon it!
They are going to turn on their firewall.
Good luck!
